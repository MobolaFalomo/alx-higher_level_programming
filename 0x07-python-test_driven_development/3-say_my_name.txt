 How to Use 3-say_my_name.py
===============================

This rary is very simple, since it only has one function called
``my_function()``.

Numbers
=======

``my_function()`` returns the product of its arguments.  For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``*`` operator.

::

    >>> from doctest_in_help import my_function
    >>> my_function(2, 3)
    6

It also works with floating-point values.

::

    >>> my_function(2.0, 3)
    6.0
